# Different trys using Pyhton

## Python Simple Render

Renders every image and combines them as a video (not the fastest)

## Python Advanced Fractal Renderer

Can render the Mandelbrot fractal and Julia fractals (no zoom for them at the moment).

Runs faster than the simple renderer - fighting to render on the GPU

Zooms only working to a certain extent - precision with the coordinates seems to be a problem
